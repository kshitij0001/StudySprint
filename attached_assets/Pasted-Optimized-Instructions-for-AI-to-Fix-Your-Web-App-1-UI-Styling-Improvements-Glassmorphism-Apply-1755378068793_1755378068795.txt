Optimized Instructions for AI to Fix Your Web App
1. UI / Styling Improvements

Glassmorphism

Apply glassmorphism style to all dropdowns, difficulty buttons, bottom bar, and popups.

Popups: When opened, the background should blur behind them.

Difficulty Buttons

Center them on the page.

Slightly colored edges to indicate difficulty.

Difficulty of a chapter = average of its topics.

Bottom Bar

Make it glassmorphic instead of transparent.

Keep 3 main icons visible + 1 hamburger menu.

Additional items appear when hamburger is clicked (bottom bar rises).

Bottom bar should remain hidden until user scrolls up.

Theme / Dark-Light Mode

Button should appear at the top, not fixed at the bottom.

Switching theme should properly change the screen color, not stay white.

Mobile Optimization

Ensure all elements are properly visible on mobile.

Avoid overlaps.

Bottom bar behavior as above.

Dropdowns, buttons, popups must scale correctly for mobile.

2. Content Management / Adding Items

Chapters & Topics

User can add a chapter, then input its name.

Within a chapter, user can add topics and name them.

User should decide the difficulty for each topic.

Difficulty of a chapter = average of its topics.

Weekly Overview / Dashboard

Remove fake data.

Show dots for upcoming reviews:

Dot color = subject.

Dot size = difficulty or number of topics:

Example: 2 topics in physics, 2 in chemistry, 2 in bio → 3 dots with size based on difficulty.

Calendar / Schedule

Remove fake entries.

Automatically update when a new chapter/topic is added.

User can tap on a date to see all items.

Swipe gestures:

Left → Remove

Right → Mark as done

Up → Snooze by 1 day

Popups for dates should be glassmorphic with blurred background.

3. Data / Fixes

Dashboard

Fix numbers showing incorrectly (currently “12” instead of actual count).

Syllabus & Plan

Fix incorrect date counts (currently 8/27, 8/29, 9/32).

Ensure all calculations of difficulty, chapter averages, and topic counts are correct and dynamically updated.

4. Bonus Enhancements

Ensure smooth animations when showing/hiding bottom bar.

All interactive elements should be mobile-friendly and responsive.

Maintain consistent spacing and alignment.

Avoid any transparency that hurts readability—prefer glassmorphism effects.
